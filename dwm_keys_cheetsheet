[Shift]+[Mod]+[Enter] - launch terminal
[Mod]+[p] - dmenu for running programs like the x-www-browser



Launch a few terminals with [Shift]+[Alt]+[Enter] and 
dwm will tile the windows between the master and stack. 
A new terminal appears on the master window. 
Existing windows are pushed upon a stack to the right of the screen. 
[Alt]+[Enter] toggles windows between master and stack.

     +----------------------------+---------------------+



Moving Around
To move to another terminal, press [Alt]+[j] or [Alt]+[k].

To move a terminal to another tag, hover to the terminal and press 
[Shift]+[Alt]+[2]. Note! If you are a frequent user of the text 
editor 'nano' the key sequence [Shift]+[Alt]+[4] will stomp on 
nano's softwrap M-$. To get around this you can unbind nano's M-$ in .nanorc thus:

unbind M-$ all
and rebind it to a new sequence thus (here bind it to 'Meta Key' + ';'):

  bind M-; softwrap all
There are several other nano key sequences that dwm will 
stomp on - use the above example to fix nano up.

To focus on another tag, press [Alt]+[tag number].

To change the amount of windows in the master area, 
press [Alt]+[d] (Decrease) or [Alt]+[i] (Increase).

To toggle a window between the master and stack area, press [Alt]+[Return]

As stated in the dwm manpage, you can click tags with 
the left mouse button and simulating [Alt]+[tag number], 
but you can also click another tag with the right mouse button 
in order to bring those windows additionally into your current focus.

To kill a window, press [Shift]+[Alt]+[c].



Layouts
By default dwm is in tiled layout mode. Ensure it is tiled mode with:

[Alt]+[t]
You should also notice the []= symbol between the tag numbers and the title bar.

dwm has two further layout modes, floating ><> [Alt]+[f] and monocle [M] [Alt]+[m]. 
Monocle is good for ensuring a window is kept maximized and focused. 
This is useful in web kiosk environments and watching flash videos. 
Further layout modes can be included through patches.

Floating
Floating layout will be familiar to Windows users. Use [Alt]+[right mouse button] 
to resize the floating window and [Alt]+[left mouse button] to move it around. 
This can also be used to raise a floating window.

There are several ways to get specific windows into being managed as a floating window, 
despite the tiled layout being activated. First there is [Alt]+[Shift]+[space], 
which will toggle floating mode on the active window. Second method is t
o simply resize the window using [Alt]+[right mouse button]. The last method 
is to [Alt]+[middle mouse button] onto the window, to toggle it in being floating. 
These floating windows then can be used to force certain window sizes, 
when some application requires this for aesthetics or simply to being usable.

If you want to set some type of window to be always floating, look at the config.def.h 
and the rules array, where the last but one element defines this behaviour.

Quitting
To quit dwm cleanly:

[Shift]+[Alt]+[q]
Status
By default dwm is showing dwm-X.X in its statusbar. This text can be changed 
by setting the WM_NAME property of the root window.

Using the tools of X.org, this can be set using:

% xsetroot -name "Some Text"
There are various tools and methods to populate this text with useful information from your system or 
services running on your system. A barebone for doing this in C is dwmstatus. See the xinitrc 
example for how to do it using a script.
